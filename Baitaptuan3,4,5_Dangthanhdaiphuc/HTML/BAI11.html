    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written 
    in a markup language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and 
    XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
     Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages,
     user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applicatidas.[1] CSS is designed primarily
      to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, 
      and fonts.[2] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
       of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share 
   <div class="footer">
    
       <p> I will be stuck here.</p>
    </div>
   
</body>
