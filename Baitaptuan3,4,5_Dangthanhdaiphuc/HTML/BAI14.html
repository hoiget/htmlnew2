        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written <br> 
        in a markup language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and <br>
        XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. <br>
        Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, <br>
        user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applicatidas.[1] CSS is designed primarily <br>
        to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, <br>
        and fonts.[2] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share
