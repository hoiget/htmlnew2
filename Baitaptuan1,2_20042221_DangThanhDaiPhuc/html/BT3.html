        <p style="text-align: left;"> <B>Lorem Ipsum</B>  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
           industry. Lorem Ipsum has been <i>the industry's standard dummy text</i>  <br>
           ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
           of type and scrambled it to make <u>a type specimen book</u> . It has <br>
           survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
           typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
           the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>
           Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br>
           software like <b>Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</b> </p>
